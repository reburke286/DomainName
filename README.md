## Overview and Description:

    This application was designed to streamline server data onto a user-friendly dashboard that checks the expirations on the Client's domain names using the server-side API, WHOIS API, Inc. © 2014 — 2019 and IMAP intergration.

## Features and Usage:

    This application is client-specific and was created to help the Client's IT Team manage their business clients for the purpose of assisting with parsing 1000+ daily emails received.

    The application streamlines data into a Dashboard, which performs a daily check to dynamically append data by color-coding the subject of data.

    The application also performs an API search to find out when domain names are expiring and alerts the Client to those domain expiration dates.

    Currently... usage for this application is client-specific, with the potential to be extended to prospective clients in the future (TBD).
