## Overview and Description:

    This application was designed to streamline server data onto a user-friendly dashboard that checks the expirations on the Client's domain names using the Third Party API, WHOIS API, Inc. © 2014 — 2019. It is used in tandem with Clients-Data, a separate front-end UI which uses JavaScript and jQuery to dynamically update the dashboard.

## Features and Usage:

    This application is client-specific and was created to help the Client's IT Team manage their business clients for the purpose of assisting with parsing 1000+ daily emails received.

    The application streamlines data into a Dashboard a.k.a. Clients-Data, which performs a daily check to dynamically append data by using a conditional statement that determines where data goes.

    The application also performs an API search to find out when domain names are expiring and alerts the Client to those domain expiration dates.

    Currently... usage for this application is client-specific, where Client will maintain and enter domain names. Also, READ ## Licensing below.

## Installation and Deployment

    1. No installation needed. Hard coded in HTML and Javascript.

## Deployed to GitHub at: https://reburke286.github.io/DomainName/

## Application Requirements:

    Third Party APIs:

        WHOIS API & Parser System (https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/) a domain, IP, and cyber threat intelligence data provider that provides real-time APIs, database downloads, and tools in domain research & monitoring and threat intelligence.

        Materialize (https://materializecss.com/) created and designed by Google, Material Design is a design language that combines the classic principles of successful design along with innovation and technology.

        Moment.js (https://momentjs.com/) a free and open source JavaScript library that removes the need to use the native JavaScript Date object directly. The library is a wrapper for the Date object (in the same way that jQuery is a wrapper for JavaScript) making the object a whole lot easier to work with.

        Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/) a free and open source font catalog that places typography front and center, inviting users to explore, sort, and test fonts for use in more than 135 languages.
